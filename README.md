# Frank Cover

Independent life insurance advisory site for Alberta, Canada.

## Local development

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the app: `npm run dev`

## Image assets

The following images need to be placed in `public/images/` for the site to display correctly:

- `frank-favicon.png` — small logo used in the footer
- `logo-transparent.png` — header logo
- `frank-avatar.png` — Frank's photo used in testimonials
- `frank-hero.png` — hero section portrait

## Lead form

The lead capture form currently shows a success state as a placeholder. Replace the `TODO` comment in `src/components/frank/LeadForm.jsx` with your preferred form backend (e.g. Web3Forms).

## Deploy

Push to `main` — Vercel auto-deploys.
